# chrome-crash
A chrome crashing script in Javascript

A very simple infinite loop that will crash Chrome or your laptop (depending on the amount of RAM available & CPU type).

Simply copy and paste this code into the console of the inspect element on your laptop (CTRL + SHIFT + I on Windows or COMMAND + OPTION + I on Mac, then swap to the second tab), press enter, and wait while it overloads your laptop with numerical requests!
